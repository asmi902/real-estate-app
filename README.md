## Description
The Real Estate Application is a full-stack project leveraging the MERN stack to streamline property management. The platform offers users the ability to:
- Search for properties based on various criteria such as location, price range, and property type.
- Visualize property locations through an interactive map.
- Securely register, log in, and save favorite properties using JWT-based authentication.
- Communicate in real-time using integrated chat functionality powered by Socket.io.
- Upload and preview property images to enhance listings.

The application provides an efficient, secure, and user-friendly interface for exploring and managing real estate listings.

## Problem Statement
The traditional real estate industry faces challenges such as fragmented information, inadequate communication, security concerns, and a lack of interactive visualization tools. Users often find it difficult to discover comprehensive listings, leading to time-consuming processes and misunderstandings in transactions.

## Proposed Solution
